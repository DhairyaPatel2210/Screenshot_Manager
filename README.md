# Screenshot-Manager

In today’s online era, all education is completely become online and during our classes we take many screenshots, But after day or two we are unable to find it where is the our screenshot which we have saved on some date. So to remove that barrier for learning I have developed one software using which you are able to manage your screenshots easily, I have developed it in such a way that it will not affect your CPU power and it will run in background. You just need to enter timings and folder path once, hardly it will take 15 mins to setup and after that you education life will be lot more easier. If you wish to see some new features then let me know on linkedin. Hope you will enjoy using this software.


# Note
